# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

CD to the project directory on your device's terminal, and run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start` 

Runs the app in the development mode.\
If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can manually

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Assumptions made

1) If you answer yes to friends in Berlin, then you can ride with them for free on weekends if they have a monthly ticket.

2) Assuming Age range between 0-4 do not have to pay any money for their tickets. 

3) Seniors and Children buy tickets at a reduced price, however, its still a ratio, so whichever ticket is recommended for adults would also apply to them. 

4) Based on prices, if you are staying for a whole month, there is no reason to ask further questions as the cheapest option would be to buy a monthly ticket.
